Day 1: Python foundations for Machine Learning
- NumPy basics
- Pandas DataFrames
- Data analysis & visualization

Day 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handled missing values
- Visualized key patterns
- Performed feature engineering

Day 3: First Machine Learning Model
- Encoded categorical variables
- Trained Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using classification metrics

Day 4: Final Model Selection:
- Baseline Logistic Regression: ~81%
- Decision Tree: overfitting
- Random Forest (tuned): balanced performance (~80%)

Conclusion:
Random Forest provided the best tradeoff between bias and variance and was selected as the final model.

Day 5: Cross-Validation & Model Selection
- Applied 5-fold cross-validation
- Tuned Random Forest using GridSearchCV
- Selected final model based on CV + test performance
